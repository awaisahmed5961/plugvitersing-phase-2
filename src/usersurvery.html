                <p>“Plugvertising”is a new banner system that allows us to offer this plugin to you for free and for
                    life.
                    Plugvertising has been designed to be non invasive and it will never interfere with your creative
                    flow.
                    Our Partners will be able to bring right into your DAW their wonderful products and present
                    some special offers available exclusively through Plugvertising.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By filling out the optional short survey we will custom tailor the advertising advices
                    so that you will receive information only about products or services that you are interested in.
                    If instead, you would rather use the plugin without the Plugvertising and use it also when offline,
                    you can buy a license at a very affordable price HERE
                    Do you want to continue with the the short survey ?
